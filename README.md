# INST326--InteractiveMovie
This is a text-based Mad Lib Story. The user would add their information and be put into the story. In order to create the story, we would take random words out of a certain section of a file and fill it. Then there will be a fight between the user and a randomly generated enemy. Once one of them is out of HP, the story is over. There is a file named "extraction1.xlsx" in our repository, which is the file that we pick random words from. And a file named "interactive_movie.py" is our main function, it shows our code about how the game will be played. We also provide a "test_interactive_movie.py" to test if our main function works correctly.
