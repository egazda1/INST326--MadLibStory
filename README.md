# INST326--InteractiveMovie
This is a text based Mad Lib Story. The user would add their information and be put into the story. In order to create the story, we would take random words out of a certain section a file and fill it. Then there will be a fight between the user and a randomly generated enemy. Once one of them is out of HP, the story is over.
